# Worksheet C

For this worksheet I have only used blueprints as it is a lot easier and more convienent to do so. As such I have not uploaded any cpp or header files. All screenshots of blueprints which I have created are stored in the ScreenShots folder (All the other folders were me trying to upload the game unsucessfully, so please only look there). I have made an executeable however it is too large to upload to github.
