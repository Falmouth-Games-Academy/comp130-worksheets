# Worksheet C

Included are both the project and a seperate file for the Blueprint screenshots and .cpp files just in case the large file size of the project causes problems.

The extra features were; destructible enemies, destructible environment pieces, and a health bar.

In the project there were some older unused .cpp files which were still referenced in memory when trying to delete, so I was apprehensive about deleting them entirely.

The .cpp files in which I worked, and are used, are MyEnemy, WorksheetCCharacter, and WorksheetCProjectile.

## Hierarchy

The enemy blueprints (Enemy_BP) inherit from MyEnemy.cpp for the inherited float Health needed in the explosive weapon damage radius sweep.

## References

As mentioned in WorksheetCCharacter.h, the methods used were learned from a series of tutorials by (Reuben Ward)[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpsN2TfWGmun4peN2IPgcKg]. Hail Reuben Ward.
