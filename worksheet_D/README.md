# Worksheet D

### Sprint One

- Set up raycast to toggle visibility of point lights
- Designed and built Github pages website for our game
- Set up Facebook and Twitter pages to advertise our game during development.
- Set up and organised a Github repoistory for our game to use until SVN server is ready.
- Organised meeting with programmers to plan and divide out tasks.

### Sprint Two

- Worked as comminicator between programmers and the rest of the team, as not everybody was making it in to Stand Ups.
- Created widget for inventory screen
- Set up function to toggle all lights in scene from light switch, using raycast.
- Set up basic pickup system, but needs to be built on.
- Set up audio activation by raycast.
- Implemented blueprints by other programmers and self into project, as still waiting for SVN server. 

### Sprint Three

- Completed pickup system, including: inventory widget with slots to display item icons once picked up, spawn and deleting widget on viewport, picking up and destroying actors (namely, keycards and axe).
- Added pickup system into game, unfortunatly was saved over by other team members, so needs to be re-added.
- Set up and organised a trello just for programmers, as we were finding it difficult to keep track of tasks in the group trello.
- Built matinee for open and closing doors, and set up function so that study door only opens with keycard present in inventory.
- Placed main menu and pause screen, made by Phil and John, into main project.
- Set up raycast in its own function, so that we can use multiple times without repeating blueprint script. This has made it much quicker to add new features and keeps the event graph tidier.

### Sprint Four

- Added five phone screens widgets and ability to use mouse cursor to press buttons on phone to switch between screens.
- Added pickup systen and door and door matinees back into game, as had been saved over.
- Edited website, adding screenshots and setting up Youtube account ready for trailer.
- Added in patricle effects to TV and fridge, so that when raycasted, they explode and/or spark.
- Implemented crouch so that player is low enough to fit under desks, however, this ended up being saved over and was put back in by John.
- Tried to stress importance of updating SVN before commiting to rest of team, as losing a lot of my work.
- Helped prepare for trailer, by fixing small bugs and giving ideas for information to include in powerpoint.

### Sprint Five

- Implemented door matinees, triggered by trigger box overlap back into game as had been saved over again.
- Set phone widget up to display in first person character mesh rather than viewport.
- Set up light switches to only turn on all lights in current room, rather than whole house, but need to add this to project again as was saved over.

### Final Sprint

For our final sprint, I need to finish implementing the 2D phone widget in world space rather than displaying on viewport. Once completed, I then need to set up buttons on phone to trigger first person character animations, followed by raycast to actor and based on actor traced, trigger an event. I also need to add the light switches by room back into the game. Following this, polishing the game and fixing any bugs picked up in playtesting.
