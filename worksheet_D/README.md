# Worksheet D

### Sprint One

- Set up raycast to toggle visibility of point lights
- Designed and built Github pages website for our game
- Set up Facebook and Twitter pages to advertise our game during development.
- Set up and organised a Github repoistory for our game to use until SVN server is ready.
- Organised meeting with programmers to plan and divide out tasks.

### Sprint Two

- Worked as comminicator between programmers and the rest of the team, as not everybody was making it in to Stand Ups.
- Created widget for inventory screen
- Set up function to toggle all lights in scene from light switch, using raycast.
- Set up basic pickup system, but needs to be built on.
- Set up audio activation by raycast.
- Implemented blueprints by other programmers and self into project, as still waiting for SVN server. 

### Sprint Three

- Completed pickup system, including: inventory widget with slots to display item icons once picked up, spawn and deleting widget on viewport, picking up and destroying actors (namely, keycards and axe).
- Added pickup system into game, unfortunatly was saved over by other team members, so needs to be re-added.
- Set up and organised a trello just for programmers, as we were finding it difficult to keep track of tasks in the group trello.
- Set up raycast in its own function, so that we can use multiple times without repeating blueprint script. This has made it much quicker to add new features and keeps the event graph tidier.
- Built matinee for open and closing doors, and set up function so that study door only opens with keycard present in inventory.
- Placed main menu and pause screen, made by Phil and John, into main project.

### Sprint Four
